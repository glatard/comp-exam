  abstract = {Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for
              neuroimaging data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to
              model high-dimensional datasets, e.g., multivariate analysis of
              activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised
              learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to
              relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while
              unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of
              images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or find
              sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different
              functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how
              scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to
              perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very
              large set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and
              unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging data provides a
              versatile tool to study the brain.},

  abstract = {Mathematical libraries are typically developed for use with the
              fixed-width data-paths on processors and target common
              floating-point formats such as IEEE binary32 and binary64. To
              address the increasing energy consumption and throughput
              requirements of HPC, scientific computing and AI applications,
              libraries and hardware implementations now provide new
              floating-point formats, allowing mathematical function
              evaluations with different performance and accuracy trade-offs.
              In this article we present a methodology and its associated
              proof-of-concept tool to evaluate the benefits of custom accuracy
              of mathematical library calls in HPC and scientific computations.
              First, our tool collects for each call-site of a mathematical
              function the input- and output-data profile. Then, using a
              heuristic exploration algorithm, we estimate the minimal required
              accuracy by rounding the result to lower precisions. The data
              profile and accuracy measurement per call-site is used to
              speculatively select the mathematical function implementation
              with the most appropriate accuracy for a given scenario. We have
              tested the methodology with the Intel MKL Vector Math (VM)
              library, leveraging the predefined accuracy levels. We
              demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two real-world
              applications: SGP4, a satellite tracking application, and PATMOS,
              a Monte Carlo neutron transport code. The robustness of the
              methodology is estimated by measuring the numerical accuracy of
              the resulting optimized code, against user-defined criteria. We
              experiment and discuss generalization across data-sets and
              finally propose a speculative runtime implementation for PATMOS.
              The experiment provides an insight into the performance
              improvements achievable by leveraging the control of per-function
              call-site accuracy-mode execution of the Intel compiler SVML
              library. We show benefits from 13 to 55 percent in time reduction
              for the PATMOS use case.},

               prognostic models across various domains, e.g. natural language
               processing, computer vision, and genomics. However, modern-day
               DNNs demand high compute and memory storage for executing any
               reasonably complex task. To optimize the inference time and
               alleviate the power consumption of these networks, DNN
               accelerators with low-precision representations of data and DNN
               parameters are being actively studied. An interesting research
               question is in how low-precision networks can be ported to
               edge-devices with similar performance as high-precision
               networks. In this work, we employ the fixed-point, floating

               within a DNN accelerator, Deep Positron, with exact

               analysis quantifies the trade-offs between overall network
               efficiency and performance across five classification tasks. Our
               results indicate that posits are a natural fit for DNN
               inference, outperforming at $\leq$8-bit precision, and can be
               realized with competitive resource requirements relative to

               However, standard compiler frameworks do not support automated

              imaging (MRI) data can accurately discriminate parkinsonian
              syndromes. Validation in patients recruited in routine clinical
              practice is missing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to
              assess the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm trained on a
              research cohort and tested on an independent clinical replication
              cohort for the categorization of parkinsonian syndromes. METHODS:
              Three hundred twenty-two subjects, including 94 healthy control
              subjects, 119 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 51 patients
              with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) with Richardson's
              syndrome, 35 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) of the
              parkinsonian variant (MSA-P), and 23 with MSA of the cerebellar
              variant (MSA-C), were recruited. They were divided into a
              training cohort (n = 179) scanned in a research environment and a
              replication cohort (n = 143) examined in clinical practice on
              different MRI systems. Volumes and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
              metrics in 13 brain regions were used as input for a supervised
              machine learning algorithm. To harmonize data across scanners and
              reduce scanner-dependent effects, we tested two types of
              normalizations using patient data or healthy control data.
              RESULTS: In the replication cohort, high accuracies were achieved
              using volumetry in the classification of PD-PSP, PD-MSA-C,
              PSP-MSA-C, and PD-atypical parkinsonism (balanced accuracies:
              0.840-0.983, area under the receiver operating characteristic
              curves: 0.907-0.995). Performances were lower for the
              classification of PD-MSA-P, MSA-C-MSA-P (balanced accuracies:
              0.765-0.784, area under the receiver operating characteristic
              curve: 0.839-0.871) and PD-PSP-MSA (balanced accuracies: 0.773).
              Performance using DTI was improved when normalizing by controls,
              but remained lower than that using volumetry alone or combined
              with DTI. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning approach based on
              volumetry enabled accurate classification of subjects with
              early-stage parkinsonism, examined on different MRI systems, as
              part of their clinical assessment. \copyright{} 2020

  abstract  = {Numerical accuracy of floating point computation is a well
               studied topic which has not made its way to the end-user in
               scientific computing. Yet, it has become a critical issue with
               the recent requirements for code modernization to harness new
               highly parallel hardware and perform higher resolution
               computation. To democratize numerical accuracy analysis, it is
               important to propose tools and methodologies to study large use
               cases in a reliable and automatic way. In this paper, we propose
               verificarlo, an extension to the LLVM compiler to automatically
               use Monte Carlo Arithmetic in a transparent way for the
               end-user. It supports all the major languages including C, C++,
               and Fortran. Unlike source-to-source approaches, our
               implementation captures the influence of compiler optimizations
               on the numerical accuracy. We illustrate how Monte Carlo
               Arithmetic using the verificarlo tool outperforms the existing
               approaches on various use cases and is a step toward automatic
               numerical analysis.},

  abstract  = {Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by
               many people. This is rather surprising, because floating-point
               is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a
               floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers
               have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called
               upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and
               virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point
               exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on
               the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on
               designers of computer systems. It begins with background on
               floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with
               a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes
               with examples of how computer system builders can better support

  abstract  = {A new data type called a posit is designed as a direct drop-in
               replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floating-point numbers floats.
               Unlike earlier forms of universal number unum arithmetic, posits
               do not require interval arithmetic or variable size operands;
               like floats, they round if an answer is inexact. However, they
               provide compelling advantages over floats, including larger
               dynamic range, higher accuracy, better closure, bitwise
               identical results across systems, simpler hardware, and simpler
               exception handling. Posits never overflow to infinity or
               underflow to zero, and ``Nota-Number'' NaN indicates an action
               instead of a bit pattern. A posit processing unit takes less
               circuitry than an IEEE float FPU. With lower power use and
               smaller silicon footprint, the posit operations per second POPS
               supported by a chip can be significantly higher than the FLOPS
               using similar hardware resources. GPU accelerators and Deep
               Learning processors, in particular, can do more per watt and per
               dollar with posits, yet deliver superior answer quality. A
               comprehensive series of benchmarks compares floats and posits
               for decimals of accuracy produced for a set precision. Low
               precision posits provide a better solution than ``approximate
               computing'' methods that try to tolerate decreased answer
               quality. High precision posits provide more correct decimals
               than floats of the same size; in some cases, a 32-bit posit may
               safely replace a 64-bit float. In other words, posits beat
               floats at their own game.},

  abstract  = {The half-precision (fp16) floating-point format, defined in the
               2008 revision of the IEEE standard for floating-point
               arithmetic, and a more recently proposed half-precision format
               bfloat16, are increasingly available in GPUs and other
               accelerators. While the support for low precision arithmetic is
               mainly motivated by machine learning applications, general
               purpose numerical algorithms can benefit from it, too, gaining
               in speed, energy usage, and reduced communication costs. Since
               the appropriate hardware is not always available, and one may
               wish to experiment with new arithmetics not yet implemented in
               hardware, software simulations of low precision arithmetic are
               needed. We discuss how to simulate low precision arithmetic
               using arithmetic of higher precision. We examine the correctness
               of such simulations and explain via rounding error analysis why
               a natural method of simulation can provide results that are more
               accurate than actual computations at low precision. We provide a
               MATLAB function, chop, that can be used to efficiently simulate
               fp16, bfloat16, and other low precision arithmetics, with or
               without the representation of subnormal numbers and with the
               options of round to nearest, directed rounding, stochastic
               rounding, and random bit flips in the significand. We
               demonstrate the advantages of this approach over defining a new

                   research. Uniform quantization using integer multiply-add
                   has been thoroughly investigated, which requires learning
                   many quantization parameters, fine-tuning training or other
                   prerequisites. Little effort is made to improve floating
                   point relative to this baseline; it remains energy
                   inefficient, and word size reduction yields drastic loss in
                   needed dynamic range. We improve floating point to be more
                   energy efficient than equivalent bit width integer hardware
                   on a 28 nm ASIC process while retaining accuracy in 8 bits
                   with a novel hybrid log multiply/linear add, Kulisch
                   accumulation and tapered encodings from Gustafson's posit

              data. However, most machine learning algorithms have not been
              designed to accommodate neuroimaging data, which typically has
              many more data points than subjects, in addition to
              multicollinearity and low signal-to-noise. Consequently, the
              relative efficacy of different machine learning regression
              algorithms for different types of neuroimaging data are not
              known. Here, we sought to quantify the performance of a variety
              of machine learning algorithms for use with neuroimaging data
              with various sample sizes, feature set sizes, and predictor
              effect sizes. The contribution of additional machine learning
              techniques - embedded feature selection and bootstrap aggregation
              (bagging) - to model performance was also quantified. Five
              machine learning regression methods - Gaussian Process
              Regression, Multiple Kernel Learning, Kernel Ridge Regression,
              the Elastic Net and Random Forest, were examined with both real
              and simulated MRI data, and in comparison to standard multiple
              regression. The different machine learning regression algorithms
              produced varying results, which depended on sample size, feature
              set size, and predictor effect size. When the effect size was
              large, the Elastic Net, Kernel Ridge Regression and Gaussian
              Process Regression performed well at most sample sizes and
              feature set sizes. However, when the effect size was small, only
              the Elastic Net made accurate predictions, but this was limited
              to analyses with sample sizes greater than 400. Random Forest
              also produced a moderate performance for small effect sizes, but
              could do so across all sample sizes. Machine learning techniques
              also improved prediction accuracy for multiple regression. These
              data provide empirical evidence for the differential performance
              of various machines on neuroimaging data, which are dependent on
              number of sample size, features and effect size.},

              evaluate their neuroscientific validity and contribution to
              understanding the brain. For neuroimaging-based machine-learning

               implementations of the respective algorithms. Support vector
               machines (SVMs) represent a powerful class of nonlinear
               classifiers, and reducing the working precision represents a
               promising approach to achieving e\_cient implementations of the
               SVM classification phase. However, the relationship between SVM
               classification accuracy and the arithmetic precision used is not
               yet su\_ciently understood. We investigate this relationship in

               working precision in floating-point arithmetic. Among the three
               representative data sets considered in this paper, none requires
               a precision higher than 15 bit, which is a considerable
               reduction from the 53 bit used in double precision
               floating-point arithmetic. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytic
               bounds on the working precision for SVMs with Gaussian kernel

                   conducting multiple hypothesis testing. The most popular
                   paradigm for false positives mitigation in high-dimensional
                   applications is via the control of the false discovery rate
                   (FDR). Multiple testing data from neuroimaging experiments
                   can be very large, and reduced precision storage of such
                   data is often required. Reduced precision computation is
                   often a problem in the analysis of legacy data and data
                   arising from legacy pipelines. We present a method for FDR
                   control that is applicable in cases where only
                   p\textbackslashtext\{-values\} or test statistics (with
                   common and known null distribution) are available, and when
                   those p\textbackslashtext\{-values\} or test statistics are
                   encoded in a reduced precision format. Our method is based
                   on an empirical-Bayes paradigm where the probit
                   transformation of the p\textbackslashtext\{-values\} (called
                   the z\textbackslashtext\{-scores\}) are modeled as a
                   two-component mixture of normal distributions. Due to the
                   reduced precision of the p\textbackslashtext\{-values\} or
                   test statistics, the usual approach for fitting mixture
                   models may not be feasible. We instead use a binned-data
                   technique, which can be proved to consistently estimate the
                   z\textbackslashtext\{-score\} distribution parameters under
                   mild correlation assumptions, as is often the case in
                   neuroimaging data. A simulation study shows that our
                   methodology is competitive when compared with popular
                   alternatives, especially with data in the presence of
                   misspecification. We demonstrate the applicability of our
                   methodology in practice via a brain imaging study of mice.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are complex, involving heterogeneous
              symptomatology and neurobiology that rarely involves the
              disruption of single, isolated brain structures. In an attempt to
              better describe and understand the complexities of psychiatric
              disorders, investigators have increasingly applied multivariate
              pattern classification approaches to neuroimaging data and in
              particular supervised machine learning methods. However,
              supervised machine learning approaches also come with unique
              challenges and trade-offs, requiring additional study design and
              interpretation considerations. The goal of this review is to
              provide a set of best practices for evaluating machine learning
              applications to psychiatric disorders. We discuss how to evaluate
              two common efforts: 1) making predictions that have the potential
              to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment and 2)
              interrogating the complex neurophysiological mechanisms
              underlying psychopathology. We focus here on machine learning as
              applied to functional connectivity with magnetic resonance
              imaging, as an example to ground discussion. We argue that for
              machine learning classification to have translational utility for
              individual-level predictions, investigators must ensure that the
              classification is clinically informative, independent of
              confounding variables, and appropriately assessed for both
              performance and generalizability. We contend that shedding light
              on the complex mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders will
              require consideration of the unique utility, interpretability,
              and reliability of the neuroimaging features (e.g., regions,
              networks, connections) identified from machine learning
              approaches. Finally, we discuss how the rise of large, multisite,
              publicly available datasets may contribute to the utility of
              machine learning approaches in psychiatry.},

                   perturbations that impact the reproducibility of
                   computational pipelines. In neuroimaging, this has important
                   practical implications on the validity of computational
                   results, particularly when obtained in systems such as
                   high-performance computing clusters where the experimenter
                   does not control software updates. We present a framework to
                   reproduce the variability induced by OS updates in
                   controlled conditions. We hypothesize that OS updates impact
                   computational pipelines mainly through numerical
                   perturbations originating in mathematical libraries, which
                   we simulate using Monte-Carlo arithmetic in a framework
                   called ``fuzzy libmath'' (FL). We applied this methodology
                   to pre-processing pipelines of the Human Connectome Project,
                   a flagship open-data project in neuroimaging. We found that
                   FL-perturbed pipelines accurately reproduce the variability
                   induced by OS updates and that this similarity is only
                   mildly dependent on simulation parameters. Importantly, we
                   also found between-subject differences were preserved in
                   both cases, though the between-run variability was of
                   comparable magnitude for both FL and OS perturbations. We
                   found the numerical precision in the HCP pre-processed
                   images to be relatively low, with less than 8 significant
                   bits among the 24 available, which motivates further
                   investigation of the numerical stability of components in
                   the tested pipeline. Overall, our results establish that FL
                   accurately simulates results variability due to OS updates,
                   and is a practical framework to quantify numerical
                   uncertainty in neuroimaging.},

              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed

              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of

               that leads to death of almost 50 \% patients in 1--2 years.
               Thus, accurate prognosis for glioma patients would provide
               essential guidelines for their treatment planning. Conventional
               survival prediction generally utilizes clinical information and
               limited handcrafted features from magnetic resonance images
               (MRI), which is often time consuming, laborious and subjective.
               In this paper, we propose using deep learning frameworks to
               automatically extract features from multi-modal preoperative
               brain images (i.e., T1 MRI, fMRI and DTI) of high-grade glioma
               patients. Specifically, we adopt 3D convolutional neural
               networks (CNNs) and also propose a new network architecture for
               using multi-channel data and learning supervised features. Along
               with the pivotal clinical features, we finally train a support
               vector machine to predict if the patient has a long or short
               overall survival (OS) time. Experimental results demonstrate
               that our methods can achieve an accuracy as high as 89.9 \% We
               also find that the learned features from fMRI and DTI play more
               important roles in accurately predicting the OS time, which
               provides valuable insights into functional neuro-oncological

              Through the encoding models, the CNN-predicted areas covered not
              only the ventral stream, but also the dorsal stream, albeit to a

  abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the
              most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development
              disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance
              imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are
              being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various
              machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated
              excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the
              availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data
              sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic
              diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this
              paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification
              method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to
              MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of
              parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data
              sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn
              discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we
              propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from
              functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data.
              Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for
              examining brain images, we design a 3-D CNN model to investigate
              the local spatial patterns of MRI features. Finally, we discover
              that brain functional and structural information are
              complementary, and design a multi-modality CNN architecture to
              combine fMRI and sMRI features. Evaluations on the hold-out
              testing data of the ADHD-200 global competition shows that the
              proposed multi-modality 3-D CNN approach achieves the
              state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15\% and outperforms reported
              classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples.
              We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising
              direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro
              development disorders.},

  abstract = {Traditional neuroimage analysis pipelines involve computationally
              intensive, time-consuming optimization steps, and thus, do not
              scale well to large cohort studies with thousands or tens of
              thousands of individuals. In this work we propose a fast and
              accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the
              automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans,
              replicating FreeSurfer's anatomical segmentation including
              surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we
              introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of
              whole-brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network
              architecture incorporates local and global competition via
              competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well
              as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor
              network performance towards accurate segmentation of both
              cortical and subcortical structures. Further, we perform fast
              cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by
              introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by directly
              mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This
              approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric
              analysis (in under 1 ​min) and surface-based thickness analysis
              (within only around 1 ​h runtime). For sustainability of this
              approach we perform extensive validation: we assert high
              segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure
              generalizability and demonstrate increased test-retest
              reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in
              dementia.},
