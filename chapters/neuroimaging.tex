\chapter{Image processing and machine learning for neuroimaging}
\begin{comment}
This section will discuss:
1. Image processing in neuroimaging
2. ML applications
3. Applicable RP concepts to neuroimaging

In the first 2 bullet point, talk in about the general field, then focus on the
main topic of interest.
Setup the context of the topic to justify the methods used.
