\chapter{Neuroimaging applications}
\label{ch:neuroimaging}
\begin{comment}
This section will discuss:
1. Image processing in neuroimaging
2. ML applications
3. Reduced precision for neuroimaging

In the first 2 bullet point, talk in about the general field, then focus on the
main topic of interest.
Setup the context of the topic to justify the methods used.

\section{Image processing}
% Mention the use of image smoothing techniques.

\section{Machine Learning applications}
%  Around 5-10 papers should be good. Concentrate on the classical ML algorithms.
% Mention of regularization methods and other smoothing techniques.

\section{Reduced precision for neuroimaging}
%  IMPORTANT describe the state of neuroimaging problems. That is, they don't have
%  ground truth. So although two pipeline give different results, that does not
%  mean that one has to be wrong. 
% Mention the paper that reduce float64 to int32 for their experiments.
% Reduce precision could have similar effect as regularization or other smoothing techniques.
